# AngularJS 2 application Oauth2 implicit flow with Azure ADB2C

This sample was built from an exisiting sample created by microsoft demonstrating Oauth2 implicit flow from a "spa" application using hello.js.  As informative as that was, it was not a very practical, as no one really creates a SPA like they provided in the sample.  So I took matters into my own hands and created a spample angular JS 2 application and found an existing library (that had to be modified to work with azure b2c) and wired up an Angular 2 JS B2C oauth2 implicit flow sample.
